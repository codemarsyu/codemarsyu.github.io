### Introduction

I am a PhD student of the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. I am currently working on data mining, machine learning, computer vision and their applications, under the supervision of Dr. [Junzhou Huang](http://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/).

Previously, I was a Research Associate at
Group, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I worked on domain adaptation for computer vision, and also a collaborative project with Rolls-Royce. Before joining NTU, I received my B.Eng. in the [Department of Civial Aviation Engineering](http://hangkong.nwpu.edu.cn/home/Department/dptshow/DepartmentofCivilAviationEngineering.htm), the [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) (NWPU),
